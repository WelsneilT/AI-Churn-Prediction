# Customer Churn Prediction with Survival Analysis

## üìå Overview

This project aims to predict **customer churn** for a subscription-based streaming service. Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses offering subscription services, as it impacts revenue and long-term customer engagement. By leveraging **predictive analytics**, businesses can anticipate churn risks and implement strategies to retain customers.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The Telco customer churn dataset contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index. It is designed to facilitate analysis of customer behavior and retention strategies.
